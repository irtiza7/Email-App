# Email-App
A simple terminal-based app to send emails.

### Why?
* Wanted a simple app to send emails from anywhere, and without logging in to Gmail. 
* These days I was sending my resume to a lot of companies and people. I would like to automate this process, in future, rather than running this app manually. 
* Need to write a process which gets triggered whenever I want and gets receiver's mail and sends my resume automatically.
